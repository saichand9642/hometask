### Continuous Delivery Plan

In this project, we follow a continuous delivery approach to streamline the deployment process. The workflow involves:

1. **Docker Build**: Each application is containerized using Docker, which allows for easy scaling and management in Kubernetes.
2. **Push to Registry**: Docker images are pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR) to make them available for deployment in different environments.
3. **Kubernetes Deployment**: Kubernetes YAML manifests define the deployment and service configurations for each application, allowing for automated scaling, updates, and management.
4. **CI/CD Integration**: The `deploy.sh` script can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline to automate the entire process of building, testing, and deploying the applications.

### Tools and Rationale

- **Docker**: Provides an efficient and portable way to containerize applications.
- **Kubernetes**: Offers a powerful orchestration platform for managing and scaling containerized applications.
- **kubectl**: Allows us to interact with the Kubernetes cluster for managing deployments, services, and resources.
- **Minikube**: Used for local Kubernetes development and testing.
- **deploy.sh**: Simplifies the deployment process by automating Docker image builds, pushing to the registry, and applying Kubernetes manifests.
