## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following tools are installed and configured:

- **Docker**: Used to build and manage container images.
  - Install Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **Kubernetes**: For container orchestration and managing the deployed applications.
  - Install Kubernetes from [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/).
- **kubectl**: The command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
  - Install kubectl from [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).
- **Minikube** (Optional): If you don't have access to a remote Kubernetes cluster, Minikube can be used to run Kubernetes locally.
  - Install Minikube from [here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/).

### Setting Up Kubernetes (Optional - Minikube)

If you are setting up Kubernetes locally using **Minikube**, follow the steps below to start a local Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
# Start Minikube
minikube start
```

This will create a local Kubernetes cluster running on your machine. Once Minikube is started, it configures `kubectl` to interact with the local cluster.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Build Docker Images
To build the Docker images for both applications, navigate to their respective directories and run:

```bash
# Build Docker image for app_a
docker build -t app_a ./app_a

# Build Docker image for app_b
docker build -t app_b ./app_b
```

### 2. Deploy to Kubernetes
After ensuring your Kubernetes cluster is set up, you can deploy the applications using the following steps.

#### Apply Kubernetes Manifests

##### Namespace Setup
First, create a namespace for the applications to run in:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s-manifests/namespace.yaml
```

##### Deploy app_a
Apply the deployment and service configurations for `app_a`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s-manifests/app_a-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s-manifests/app_a-service.yaml
```

##### Deploy app_b
Similarly, apply the deployment and service configurations for `app_b`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s-manifests/app_b-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s-manifests/app_b-service.yaml
```

### 3. Verify Deployments
After the deployments, check if the applications are successfully running by listing the pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

To confirm that the services are running properly, you can get the list of services:

```bash
kubectl get svc
```

### 4. Access the Applications
To access the applications locally (if using Minikube), run the following commands:

```bash
# Access app_a via the Minikube service
minikube service app_a-service

# Access app_b via the Minikube service
minikube service app_b-service
```

This will open the applications in your browser.

## Continuous Deployment

For continuous deployment, you can use `deploy.sh`, a script for automating deployments. This script can be customized for your CI/CD pipelines.

### deploy.sh
The `deploy.sh` script automates the process of building Docker images, pushing them to a registry, and applying Kubernetes manifests to deploy the applications.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Build Docker images
docker build -t app_a ./app_a
docker build -t app_b ./app_b

# Push Docker images to your container registry
docker push app_a
docker push app_b

# Apply Kubernetes manifests for deployment
kubectl apply -f k8s-manifests/namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s-manifests/app_a-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s-manifests/app_a-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s-manifests/app_b-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s-manifests/app_b-service.yaml

echo "Deployment Complete!"
```

Run the script:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

This script automates the process of building the Docker images, pushing them to a registry, and applying the Kubernetes manifests to deploy the applications.

## CD_Plan.txt

### Continuous Delivery Plan

In this project, we follow a continuous delivery approach to streamline the deployment process. The workflow involves:

1. **Docker Build**: Each application is containerized using Docker, which allows for easy scaling and management in Kubernetes.
2. **Push to Registry**: Docker images are pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR) to make them available for deployment in different environments.
3. **Kubernetes Deployment**: Kubernetes YAML manifests define the deployment and service configurations for each application, allowing for automated scaling, updates, and management.
4. **CI/CD Integration**: The `deploy.sh` script can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline to automate the entire process of building, testing, and deploying the applications.

### Tools and Rationale

- **Docker**: Provides an efficient and portable way to containerize applications.
- **Kubernetes**: Offers a powerful orchestration platform for managing and scaling containerized applications.
- **kubectl**: Allows us to interact with the Kubernetes cluster for managing deployments, services, and resources.
- **Minikube**: Used for local Kubernetes development and testing.
- **deploy.sh**: Simplifies the deployment process by automating Docker image builds, pushing to the registry, and applying Kubernetes manifests.

## Conclusion

By following the steps above, you will have a fully functioning setup of `app_a` and `app_b` running on Kubernetes, either locally using Minikube or on a remote cluster. This setup ensures that your deployments are repeatable and easily managed using Kubernetes.

This `README.md` provides all necessary details for setting up, building, and deploying the applications locally or in a Kubernetes environment, with clear instructions on how to run everything from Docker image building to deployment.
